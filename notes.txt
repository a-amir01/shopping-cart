----------------NODE------------------

* spread operator
    let s = [1,2,3]
    let v = [...s]; //copy of s

* use slice to remove a value from a specific index
    let names = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g'];
    const indexToRemove = 3;  //remove 'd'
    let slicedNames = [...names.slice(0, indexToRemove), ...names.slice(indexToRemove + 1)];

----------------REDUX-----------------
PURE FUNCTION: given the same input the function will always return the same output
STORE: hold the whole state tree of the app
Actions: payloads of info that send data from your app to your store. They are
         the only source of info for the store, send using "store.dispatch()"
Reducers: Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don;t specify how the
          app's state changes in response. this is the job of reducers

Dispatch: The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and
          the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state.
          It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.
Provider: A provider is nothing more than a combination of actions and reducers designed to work together to manage
          shared state across multiple components. A merge function, middleware, and/or enhancer may also be included.
* 3 PRINCIPLES OF REDUX
    1. Single source of truth
        The state of your whole app is stored in an object tree within a single store
    2. State is READ-ONLY
        the only way to change the state is to emit an Action
    3. Chnages are made with pure function
        reducers have to be pure-function

IMMUTABILITY OF THE STATE:
* when making operations with arryas:
        - DO NOT USE MUTABLE METHODS: push() or splice()
        - use: concat(), slice() or ...spread operator


---------------REACT-REDUX----------------
React provides the ability to spin up new rooms, and Redux provides the Genie mind-reader logic behind their production.
http://www.youhavetolearncomputers.com/blog/2015/9/15/a-conceptual-overview-of-redux-or-how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-javascript-state-container

- The main differences between Redux and full flux implementations are:
    * There are no discrete dispatchers in Redux; your store listens directly for actions, and uses a function called a reducer (more on this later) to return a new app state each time an action is dispatched.
    * Redux holds your entire application's state in one place.
    * Your app's state is immutable.

store -> provider
in order to make the redux store available in react we need redux component called provider
Provider: wraps entire react app and passes this store as a props to react components

------------------REACT ROUTER---------------LEC 29
Router: Wraps all react app and register all internal roots

Route: allows to define roots and respective component to render

IndexRoute: Allows to define which component should be rendered first when our main component is rendered

BrowserHistory & HashHistory: Listen and track all internal urls
BrowserHistory: dependent from Routes set in the server
HashHistory: independently from the Routes set in our server
    - marks any route with a '#'
    - helpful during development
    - allows testing routes independently from server routes
    - not good for production
    - not seo compliant


---------------MOGNO--------------------
db.books.insert(
    {
        "title": "First book title",
        "description": "first book des",
        "price": 15.34,

    }
)

db.getCollection('books').find({})
db.getCollection('books').find({
    "price": {$gt: 15}
})

db.books.update(
    {"_id": ObjectId("594c98ac5563e8ee6c477d23")},
    {$set: {"title": "this is updated"}}  //without set only thing in there will be title other fields deleted

)

db.books.update(
    {"_id": ObjectId("594c98ac5563e8ee6c477d22")},
    {$set: {"title": "this book didnt exist"}},
    {upsert: true}   //if the field doesnt exists it will create it for you
)

db.books.update(
    {"price": {$gt: 20},
    {$set: { "discount": 55}},
    {multi:true},
)

---------------API-----------------
Advanced REST Client (chrome extention)

worksflow:
1. UI sends a book obj to action creator
2. action creator will NOT directly dispatch the book payload to the reducer
    - instead
        1. makes http request to the api using axios
        2. when request is delivered to mongodb the response will be sent back to action creator
        3. then the action creator dispatches it to the reducers
        4. then the state is updated with the new data
        5. the UI is rerendered with the new data in the store which is the data in the db

AXIOS: http client
SUPPORTS:
    1. promise
    2. work on client and server,
    3. cross-side request forgery protection by default
allows: write sml, http request

REDUX-THUNK: middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action


REVERSE PROXY: type of proxy server that retires data on behalf of client from one or more servers(API server in our case)
retrive all data request to api server
proper separation of concerns
cleaener code
security: internal network structure is hidden to client
"ALL HTTP requests to localhost:3000/api/* will be routed to: localhost:3001"
To identify anonymos users we will create persistent session
    1. the 1st time a user connects to a websote the server will send a cookie with the session id
    2. cookie: small document the browser stores on client computer
        cookie: store limited amount of data
    3. it can be accessed again by the server
    4. next time user will connect to our website the server will read the cookie and recognize the session id

store the session id in a cookie and cart data in mongodb and associaite it with a session id
    need to track sessions in our api server
    when the session is expired the relative cart data will auto be deleted from db
